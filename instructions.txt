TEST: Make a Tier List Ranking of a topic of your choosing. You must rank a minimum of 6 items by adding them to the 'tier' divs. You will not need to write CSS in this test (but you will still need to look at it). 

Follow the instructions below to complete the test. 

1: Pick a topic to rank (i.e. Pokemon, Video Games, etc.) and change the title of the site to match.

2: Make the background-color of each tier rank work (i.e. 'S', 'A', etc.). Do this by adding an ID to each element with class='tier'. You can see what the IDs should be by looking at the CSS style that is already there. Do not change any CSS. 

3: Add in your items. Do this by making a div with the class of 'item' for each item that you add to the list. Each item should have an image inside and some text.
